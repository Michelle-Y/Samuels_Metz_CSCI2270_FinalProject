CSCI 2270 final project

Austin Metz and I are on a team. We are still discussing the topic we are going to choose. One idea is that we are going to create a program that identifies the fastest form of data structure to sort information. We will primarily cover the data structures that we learned in this class. We hope our end result gives us a more solid understanding of each data structure technique and helps us to become better programers.

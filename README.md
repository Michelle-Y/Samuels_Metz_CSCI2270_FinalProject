CSCI 2270 final project

Project	Summary
Our program is a binary search tree that stores statistics gathered from a gaming website called DotaBuff.com.
The program reads into a file that has the statistics written and creates the binary search tree.
The user is promted with a menue of 6 options. 
Each option has a function that allows the user to maniupulate the data within the binary search tree.
On the Edit character stats button, you will see a sub-menue that lets the user change the stats of any hero. 

How	to	Run
1)Load the main.cpp, Heroes.cpp, Heroes.h file into an ide of your choice. We used the typical vm- codeblocks. 
2)Make sure the Heroes.txt file is in the same place as the other files. 
3)Once compiled together, press the build and run button. 
4)You will be displayed a drop down menu.
5)Feel free to play around with the menu, there is a drop down menu for "Edit Hero Stats"
6)Use the statistical data base to keep your player information up to date. 
7)To exit the program press the 6 button. 

Dependencies
Our program does not rely on third party libraries. As long as the .txt file and the source files are in the same folder that you are running the program under, it will work. 


System	Requirements
Our program will run on windows, mac, and linux.
